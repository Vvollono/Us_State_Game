#Create a US States Quiz

Code an educational game where the user guess the name of the 50 States in the US using Turtle module and pandas module with csv file
The Turtle screen show a blanck map of the United Stestes with a prompt where the user can input his answers.
Once the user guess the correct name of the state the turtle moves the answer on the map in the position of the State guessed.
The prompt shows at the guess how many States he need to guess on 50.
Once the user reach 50/50 the game ends

#Added function that if the user type exit the game stopped and create a database where the user can check what States has missed
If the user doesn't guess all the State in the map can input exit and the program generate a new file called state_to_learn.csv where can check which one he has missed.
